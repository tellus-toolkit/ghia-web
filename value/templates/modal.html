                <p>Taking part and all questions within this survey are voluntary. From section 2 onwards there are no
                    right or wrong answers - we are interested purely in your opinion.</p>
                <p>The information provided by people taking part in this survey will only be used for research
                    purposes. It will not be used for commercial reasons. All data will be treated in accordance with
                    the Data Protection Act (1998).</p>
                <p>We will not collect peopleâ€™s names, phone numbers or IP addresses. We will however, ask for the
                    postcode of your home address to be provided. This is in order to locate your responses on a map
                    anonymously. In circumstances where there are very few households within a postcode area, providing
                    your postcode could link your answers to your household. However, in practice it is unlikely you
                    would be identifiable from providing your postcode, and this is not an aim of the research. Your
                    postcode will not be published, and at no time will your data be used in a way which compromises
                    your right to confidentiality.</p>
                <p>Your data will be stored on a secure, password protected server and protected through encryption
                    where appropriate. Anonymised research data will be archived at the UK Data Archive Service or
                    similar, in order to make it available to other researchers in line with current data sharing
                    practices.</p>
                <p>It is important to understand that, by saying you consent to taking part in this survey, you agree
                    that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>you understand you can withdraw your answers at any time during or at the end of the survey</li>
                    <li>your information will stored in line with data protection policy</li>
                    <li>your words (but no identifiable information) may be quoted in publications, reports, web pages,
                        and other research outputs
                    </li>
                    <li>you consent to confidential and protected data sharing with all members of our research team
                    </li>
                    <li>your information can be archived at a suitable social science data archiving service</li>
                    <li>you understand other genuine researchers will have access to this data and may use your words in
                        research outputs if they agree to preserve your confidentiality as requested in this form
                    </li>
                </ul>
